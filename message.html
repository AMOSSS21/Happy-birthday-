Honestly, I don’t even know where to start because putting into words how I feel about you never feels enough. 
You’ve become someone incredibly special to me, more than you can imagine. <br><br>

Every moment with you matters, every smile, every laugh, every glance. 
Thanks for always being there for me, for supporting me, and for being the amazing person you are. <br><br>

I will always love you with all my heart and forever. 
You are my world, my joy, and my heart’s home. ❤️
