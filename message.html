                Honestly, I don’t even know where to start because putting into words how I feel about you never feels like enough. 
                You’ve become someone so incredibly special to me, more than you probably realize.<br><br>
                
                You’re not just important to me. You’re someone who has quietly become a part of my days, my thoughts, my happiness. 
                Someone who can change my mood without even trying. And I genuinely mean this, I love you.<br><br>
                
                On your special day, I just want you to know how much you matter to me. 
                <b>Thanks for always being there for me.</b> No matter what happens, I’ll always have a soft corner for you, 
                always support you, and stand by you.<br><br>
                
                I hope this year brings you everything—happiness, peace, and everything your heart wishes for. 
                <b>I will always love you with all my heart and forever.</b>
            </p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold; color: #c2185b; font-size: 1.2rem;">
                Stay amazing. Stay you. I will always love you with all my heart and will forever. 😌❤️
